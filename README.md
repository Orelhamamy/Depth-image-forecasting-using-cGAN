# Depth image forecasting
By Orel Hamamy(https://github.com/Orelhamamy) and [Or Tslil](https://github.com/ortslil64). This project is the final 
BSc project.
 
This project includes:
1) ROS package generates a sequence of depth images, with two Gazebo worlds. 
2) Python scripts for generating, training, and evaluating cGAN models(2D&3D-convolution).
3) Implementation of a trained model within the simulated environment.

## Example
Deploying of forecasting depth images model within Gazebo simulation
